    <h1>My goals</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Why do I want to learn this skill?</h3>
            What does it mean to you? What are your motivations? Will you prove something to yourself or
            people around you? Will you get a raise because you’re better at your job or will you get a better job?</li>
        <p><b>Ans</b>. <em>My main motivation to learning this new skill is to make maximum use of my own potential. This is an
                uncharted
                territory for me and this time I want to go all in. 
                Yes, obviously I want to prove it to myself that I can experience the joy of creating something from
                scratch and really engineer
                a solution and make something better than it already is.
                I might get a raise and yes I definately believe I will get a job which will open doors for new
                opportunities and make things better
                for me both personally and professionaly.
            </em></p>
        <li><h3>What will I achieve if I learn this skill?</h3>
            Which doors will this skill open for you? Will you be able to earn more, have more flexibility in your
            work hours, work remotely and travel more?</li>
        <p><b>Ans</b>. <em>Yes, I will achieve a better income, a better lifestyle and most of all, a better sense of self
                esteem - something which is
                very vital to me.
                By <strong>Better Self Esteem</strong> I mean working towards creation of something new and maintaining
                its quality means more to
                me than just ensuring just the quality.
            </em></p>
        <li><h3>How will this skill change my life and my career?</h3>
            Would you get a raise at your current job or more respect from your boss once you’ve learnt this skill?
            Or will you be at Facebook, Amazon or Google instead? How would your life change?</li>
        <p><b>Ans</b>.Yes, I believe I will garner more respect from everyone really, since this path is mostly uncharted.
            <em>To have started my career
                as a <strong>Quality Assurance Engineer</strong> and now to becoming a <strong>Full Stack Web
                    Developer</strong> is a very cool thing to do!
                <br>
                My life will change in the sense that my thought patterns (thus my Habits and Personlaity) will undergo
                a massive shift. And that is
                something I always strive to do. Recreate myself from time to time because that is how growth happens.
            </em> </p>
        <li><h3>How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family,
            friends and coworkers?</h3>
            What will you be able to do for your family or friends once you’ve learnt this skill? How will it change
            the way they think of you? Will your coworkers respect you more?</li>
        <p><b>Ans</b>. <em>The life of my family members will be better improved since I will be working in a more dynamic and
                high impact career.
                Programming is career path which has infinite scope. With a better job prospect and hands on over new
                technologies, I'll
                be able to ensure the lifestyle of me and my family is always the best.
                Yes, I agree that my friends and family would respect me a lot more (they do so now too), a different
                kind of respect. The one that
                you get when you pull off a really complex yet mesmerizing magic trick - only this time it wont just be a birthday party trick!
                Achivening this goal, will be a testament to how one person (moi) can achieve great heights through percevierence and 
                dedication.
            </em></p>
        <li><h3>How will I feel if I never accomplish this?</h3>
            Would you feel disappointed? Would you feel like you’ve missed out?</li>
        <p><b>Ans</b>.<em><strong>I dont think about that. Because that is never going to happen. As I said, this time I am going
                all in. :D :)</strong></em></p>
        <li>What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?
            Visualise it. What would life look like from the moment you wake up to the time you go to sleep? Will
            you be living by the sea? Would you kiss your beautiful wife/husband when you wake up?</li>
        <p><em>This is soo beautiful. Yes, I would be living in a very safe house by a beautiful sea and kiss my wife when
            I wake up (after brushing
            my teeth of course).
            What my life would look like - well having worked in Quality Assurance Engineering I'd have a different
            approach towards programming : while
            I'd be focused on creating, i'll always have the quality aspect at the back of my mind. I'd enjoy and would
            see all my outputs as
            a painting. Like an artist. And most of all - I'd have my own respect! A very very deep respect!
